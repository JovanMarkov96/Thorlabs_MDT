Thorlabs End-user License (summary)
=================================

This file is a plain-text summary of the Thorlabs End-user License Agreement (EULA)
that accompanies the MDT SDK and related vendor DLLs. A copy of the original RTF
EULA (as provided by Thorlabs) is available locally at:

  .mdt_dlls/License_V2.4.2/License/Thorlabs/Thorlabs End-user License.rtf

Key points (non-exhaustive, read the full license before redistributing):

- This EULA is a binding contract; by using the Software you accept its terms.
- Thorlabs grants a non-exclusive license to use the Software.
- Redistribution: the EULA explicitly permits making copies and giving copies to
  other persons or entities provided that the copies include the Agreement and
  retain Thorlabs' copyright and proprietary notices.
- Use restriction: the Software may only be used in combination with Thorlabs
  equipment; other uses are prohibited.
- You may not rent, lease, or sublicense the Software. Transfer is allowed only
  if the transferee assumes the Agreement.
- Reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembly and attempts to discover source
  code are prohibited.
- The Software is provided "AS IS" without warranty; Thorlabs disclaims liability
  for damages and provides standard warranty limitation language.
- Governing law: United States (per the EULA text read).

Recommendation (conservative, professional):
- Do NOT commit vendor DLL binaries into the public repository unless you have
  verified that your particular copy and the SDK version you redistribute are
  covered by the EULA and you include the full EULA text alongside the binaries.
- Preferred approach: keep the `.mdt_dlls/` directory ignored and provide
  instructions (below) for users to obtain the DLLs themselves from Thorlabs.

See `docs/obtain_dlls.md` for step-by-step instructions and script guidance.
